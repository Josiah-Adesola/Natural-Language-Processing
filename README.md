# Natural-Language-Processing

This is a tutorial repository following on [Pradip Nichite](https://github.com/PradipNichite/Youtube-Tutorials) GitHub page. 

I tried practicing follow his [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAMHV77MSKJ4Z4OXqao1gRdfQK7VQYAXb). You can also work through it here. 

So, the codes here are gotten from his repo, I just practiced, tweaked little things to my taste and to work on my own machine. 

It's your choice to go directly to his site or learn from here.

The link to the dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge?rvi=1)
